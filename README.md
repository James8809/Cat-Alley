# Cat-Alley
This is a game project which me and two other programmers did during cmpm121 course as a final project in two and a half weeks. It is a simple endless runner game made by Unity. The theme of the game features a police chasing and capturing street cats in dark alleys. In the game, player will have to dodge the upper beam by looking upward or downward like doing Matrix type dodges and also jump over the lower beam by pressing spacebar. In addition, the player will have to aim and shoot at the cats moving forward. The player will lose health if the cat passes the player or the player missed the cat when shooting.
