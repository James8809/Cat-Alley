# Cat-Alley
This is a game project which me and two other programmers did during cmpm121 course as a final project. It is a simple endless runner game made by Unity. The theme of the game features a police capturing street cats in dark alleys. In the game, player have to dodge the upper beam by looking upward or downward like doing Matrix type dodges and also jump over the lower beam. In addition the player will have to aim and shoot the cats around the beam and will also lose health if the player let cats pass through.
